Please Make Code Civilization By Code I mean all forms of programming contests questions that is to be used in the programming assestmentsin interviews. There are three levels the Easy level where one just starts off, the Medium Level the intermediates the Hard level for the hard problem solvers. Every day there is a daily checkin, easy level requires one easly per day medium requires one medium per day and one hard requires one hard per day. Such is inspired by Evbo's Parkour civlizatoin. Perks easy just do quesiton, medium have access to the job board and coffee chats in addition to resume reviews. Hard have access to exclusive job opportunity and prip=ority access for resume viewing in addition

By Leetcode I do not mean only leetcode I also mean Hackerrank, Atcoder and codeforces problems

Or I shall call it a better name than leetcode.

Every day one must submit a verification of a problem that is solved on that day. It could be on hackerrank, codeforces, leetcode etc. Other people who have solved the problem on that platform woujld need to verify it to sign the "certificate" informing the platform of completion.


Also add a way on how to go between the levels.

TO go from easy to medium one must complete a programming contest where the first two questions are easy tier and second two are medium tier at the weekly contest

To go from medium to hard one need to complete two medium and two hard to get to the hard level

ONe must complete all the questions to level up.

Also leveling down is also possible. if you are inactive you would be automaticlaly put into the inactive level and need to take a test to determine your new position.

ONe can use Gen AI to serch up generic algorithems however one is prohibited from using gen AI to complete problems. The community members who solved the problems can verify and report if the problem is solved with GEN AI and it would not count as a proper daily chekin.

If one have missed a daily checkin they would hae a strike board and need to make up for it some time later on
