Okay, here's an organization of the chat content, breaking it down into key features and requirements for the "CodeCivilization" platform:

**I. Core Concept & Levels:**

* **Name:** CodeCivilization (or a better name to be decided).
* **Focus:** Programming contest questions for assessment in interviews and skill development.
* **Levels:**
    * **Easy:** For beginners. Requires solving one easy problem per day.
    * **Medium:** For intermediates. Requires solving one medium problem per day.
    * **Hard:** For advanced problem solvers. Requires solving one hard problem per day.

**II. Daily Check-in & Verification:**

* **Requirement:** Daily submission of a solved problem from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, AtCoder, Codeforces, etc.
* **Verification Process:** Solutions are verified by other community members who have solved the same problem on the same platform.
* **"Certificate":** Upon verification by peers, a confirmation ("certificate") is recorded on the platform.
* **GEN AI Policy:**
    * Allowed for searching generic algorithms.
    * Strictly prohibited for solving problems.
    * Community members can verify and report AI usage for non-compliance (results in no proper daily check-in).
* **Missed Check-ins:** A "strike board" tracks missed daily check-ins, requiring users to make them up later.

**III. Level Progression:**

* **Easy to Medium:** Complete a weekly programming contest where the first two questions are Easy tier and the second two are Medium tier. All four questions must be completed to level up.
* **Medium to Hard:** Complete two Medium tier problems and two Hard tier problems. All four questions must be completed to level up.

**IV. Leveling Down & Inactivity:**

* **Leveling Down:** Possible due to inactivity.
* **Inactive Level:** Users who are inactive are automatically moved to an inactive level.
* **Re-evaluation:** To return to an active level, users need to take a test to determine their new appropriate level.

**V. Perks:**

* **Easy:** Just the requirement to do the question.
* **Medium:**
    * Access to a job board with new postings.
    * Coffee chats with industry professionals.
    * Resume reviews.
* **Hard:**
    * All Medium level perks.
    * Exclusive job opportunities from partner companies.
    * Priority access for resume viewing by recruiters.

This organized breakdown clarifies the core features, rules, and progression system for the CodeCivilization platform. It highlights the different levels, the daily engagement and verification process, the requirements for moving between levels, consequences of inactivity, and the benefits associated with each tier.
