_
@hojokban, a popular restaurant in Seoul, is opening a location (@hojokban.nyc) at 128 Madison Avenue in a couple of days! I was grateful to try the menu before the opening and everything was really tasty. Not one bad dish and we basically tried the entire menu 😂; i loved the little appetizer they start you out with - kimchi paired with slightly caramelized goguma (korean sweet potato). All of the labeled “signature dishes” on the menu are really solid; we especially loved the marinated galbi, ssook-got salad (reminds me of don angie’s chrysanthemum salad), jangjorim butter fried rice and yakbap mont blanc dessert (so good that we ordered two).

SAUCE RECIPE

Servings: 1-2 portions
1 tsp black pepper
3 ea grated garlic
2 tbsp honey
1 tbsp oyster sauce
3 tbsp tamari
Pinch of salt

🥩 Mix em all up and set aside

TO COOK:
250 gr sliced beef (I used diced wagyu but if you use a steak like me it's better to sear both sides first for 2 minutes, set aside, and slice)
1 cup rice
125 gr canned corn
1 ea spring onion
20 gr butter
More peoper if needed

🥩 Heat up your skillet with high heat. Add 1 tsp oil and cook 1/2 ea sliced onion for 1 minute
🥩 Assemble beef, rice, corn, spring onion, butter and leave it for 2 minutes on high heat
🥩 Pour in the sauce and mix em all up
🥩 TIPS ✨ If you want a crispy bottom, spread the rice evenly and leave if for 3-5 minutes or until you find the bottom crisp up.

ENJOY AND DON'T BURN YOUR TOUNGE! 🔥 If you make this recipe make sure to tag me because I loveee seeing your creations!

I made customised luggage tags 🧳 ✈️ like this for a few members of family and they loved having something unique from South Korea. 

There are various places to do this across the city. 📍 Today, I’m at 쌈지길 (Ssamziegil) which is a mall and cultural complex in 인사동(Insadong). You’ll find this shop on Level 2.

💸 Price for the DIY bag tag: 
₩10,400 | £6.47 | $8.03 | R148.
Letters and different patches are all prices separately. 

Once you’ve picked 🕵🏻‍♀️ what you want to customise, you choose our your letters, symbols and emojis, lay them out on your item 📏 and then hand them off to the employee in-store. It only takes a few minutes to iron on so you can either wait ⏰ or walk around and come back later. 

There are so many cute different patches (what are they even called?!) to choose from. 🍋 🌻 ✈️ 

☑️ While you’re at Ssamziegil, take a look at the other unique galleries and stores. There’s loads of handmade products and creative shops.

100년 된 고택이 있던 고택을 재생시킨 우물집입니다. 

칸칸이 자리가 나뉜 프라이빗한 분위기 속에서 고즈넉함을 담은 공간인데요. 자리마다 우물을 모티브로 한 족자 원형창을 내었습니다. 

대표 메뉴는 1인상 형태로 솥밥과 함께 제공되는 차돌박이 전골인데요. 맑은 야채, 맛간장, 매콤 토마토로 3가지 선택이 가능해요. 개인적으로는 매콤 토마토 전골을 추천드리는데, 토마토의 감칠맛과 매콤한 국물의 조화가 기억에 남습니다. 솥밥은 뜨거운 물이 제공되어 누룽지로도 즐길 수 있어요. 

 [우물집] @woomoolzip
- 위치: 서울 종로구 창신길 200
- 영업: 10:00 - 21:00
- 메뉴: 한우 차돌박이 전골과 솥밥 3종 (29.0)

[Woomoolzip] @woomoolzip

This is a well-restored well-house that has been standing for a hundred years. It features a private and cozy atmosphere with divided spaces, each adorned with circular windows inspired by well motifs.

The signature dish is a single-serving hot pot with marbled beef brisket, accompanied by rice. The hot pot comes in three variations: vegetable broth, savory soy sauce, and spicy tomato. Personally, I recommend the spicy tomato hot pot, as the harmonious blend of tomato‘s richness and the spicy broth creates a memorable experience. The rice is served with hot water, allowing you to enjoy crispy rice crust, known as ”nurungji.“

- Location: 200 Changsin-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul
- Hours: 10:00 AM - 9:00 PM

サシがかなり綺麗で脂のりは凄いのにすっきりくどくなく、口の中でとろける中トロ🍖

フルーティーな味わいは癖になるし、臭みが無いからボリュームがあっても箸が進み続ける！

A tuna bowl restaurant with long lines!? An exquisite medium-sized fatty tuna bowl that can only be eaten on weekdays at a directly managed tuna wholesaler🐟🍖

The bright and beautiful pink medium fatty tuna is only 1,600 yen even if you add a lot more toppings and a large serving of rice👀

It's so voluminous that you can't even see the rice even if you turn it over when the medium-sized fatty tuna is in full bloom and it's the best👼

The marbling is pretty nice and the fat is amazing, but it's not too bitter and melts in your mouth.🍖

The fruity taste is addictive, and there's no odor, so your chopsticks will keep going even if it's voluminous!

The sweetness of the vinegared rice is an accent and it’s delicious🤤

This is by far the most delicious seafood bowl I've had recently and I highly recommend it.",4you_sns,2023-12-18_09-34-29_UTC.mp4,げんき水産,Japan,"げんき水産,大阪府大阪市此花区西九条２丁目１０−６",

If you’re travelling in a group of 3-4 or more, the 3rd hotel in the video will be the best fit👨‍👩‍👦‍👦

If you want a more luxurious staycation type of experience, the 2nd hotel will be a lovely stay🤭🥰

There’s a few gyukatsu places in Japan, but Gyukatsu Motomura is the honestly the GOAT 🙌🏼

for those who’ve never had gyukatsu, it’s basically a beef cutlet that’s flash fried and then you get to finish grilling each piece yourself on the hot stone at your table!

The most popular thing to order at Gyukatsu Motomura is the set that comes with cabbage, side dishes and dipping sauces, along a little warabi mochi for dessert! Make sure you try the onion dressing on the cabbage it is DIVINE 😛

For me this place is definitely worth the hype, definitely recommend trying for yourself if you visit Japan! They have several locations across the country in Tokyo, Osaka and Fukuoka 😀

SAVE for your Japan food bucket list 🍜

I INSTANTLY added Jean Frigo to my list of best hidden bars in Seoul that I had to visit when I was researching for my trip to Seoul, Korea 

It is located on a small side street in a residential area hidden inside a fruit shop that is completely abandoned aside from some music playing in the store

Walk into the cute fruit store and locate the fridge door that is the entrance to the speakeasy

They serve up fruit themed cocktails and as a mostly non alcoholic drinker I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the drinks!

Drinks shown are $18 each 

If you are planning a trip to Korea soon I strongly recommend you mae time for Jean Frigo, Toegye-ro 62-gil, Gwanghui-dong 2(i)-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul, South Korea

.
Lou Mitchell’s opened in Chicago in 1923 as a family diner, and it has held steady ever since! This year even marked its 100 year anniversary, so you know that it must be good with that kind of staying power!
.
The restaurant marks the start of the famous Route 66 that connects Chicago to California, and they’ve been serving up the same recipes since the diner opened. 
.
Three things to watch out for when you visit:
.
1️⃣ The amazing hostess Donna who is 95 years old!
2️⃣ Donut holes with your breakfast (free since 1958)!
3️⃣ Get there early because they tend to get busy.
.
There are plenty of great things to order when you visit, but we think they do great pancakes and skillets!
.
Send this video to someone who should take you to Lou Mitchell’s for breakfast this weekend! 🙌

📍 @myeongdong_kyoja has won the @michelinguide 💫 7 years in a row now and I can totally see why! Seriously the best mandu’s and kalguksu I’ve had ever. We even went back a second time cause we couldn’t leave Korea without having it once more 🥲 

✨ Mandu (dumplings)
✨ Kalguksu (handmade noodle soup) 
✨ Bibimguksu (spicy wheat noodle - April to October) 
✨ Kongguksu (bean noodles - available June to August only).

Make sure to save this so that you don’t miss out! 

Tip: go either a couple hours before or after lunch & dinner times so you can avoid the lines!

-
📍 Jayeondo Saltbread - 56-1 Yeonmujang-gil, Seongdong-gu, Seoul
-
Jayeondo Saltbread in Sungsudong, Seoul, is a must-visit for bread enthusiasts. Here’s why:

📌 Freshly Baked Daily: The bread, known for its delightful salty flavor, is freshly baked
📌 Unique Ordering Experience: Orders are placed at a kiosk, and a voucher is given for bread pickup (Seongsu store)
📌 Limited Availability: there is a huge line for this and limited! 
📌 Taste and Texture: Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy inside, with a rich buttery flavor
📌 Packaging: Comes in a vibrant, attractive package, making it a great gift option :) 
–
The combination of a crispy exterior and a soft, flavorful interior makes their salt bread highly sought-after. Visitors often find themselves captivated not just by the taste but also by the charming atmosphere of the bakery. Although there’s no seating available at the Seongsu location, the experience of savoring these heavenly breads is well worth the visit. Oh, they also have other outlets in Seoul as well, Ikseondong.

🥟 Myeongdong Kyoja is a definite MUST VISIT if you’re in Seoul! I was staying at Aloft Seoul Myeongdong which was literally minutes walk away from this bustling restaurant. unfortunately my airline delayed my baggage for 28 hours so I had to make do with my pajamas and im lookin a lil crusty 🥲 solo diner friendly!

😍 they only have 4 menu items & I literally ordered 3 out of 4 - their Chopped Noodles (Kalguksu), Dumplings (Mandu), and Spicy Noodles (Bibimguksu). the last item is Soybean Noodles, and this is only available from April to October. everything is made in house and so fresh, I loved the kimchi too! I was def getting crazy looks for getting the entire menu for myself but I had to see the hype

😋 the Kalguksu was SO comforting, with perfect noodles in an amazing broth. I was also obsessed with the Mandu that were filled up with pork and fragrant leeks. I got full on these two and thought I could take the cold noodles home but they only have take out boxes for the Mandu 🥲 cold noodles were good but not as amazing as the other two! highly, highly recommend, was a great start to my trip despite what happened

🤔 questions about my solo trip? feel free to ask or stay tuned for more videos about it 🤗

💸 Kalguksu & Cold Noodles 11K won or $8
Dumplings 12K won or $9

+폭탄계란찜이랑 먹으면 더 맛있으니 꼭 같이 주문하세요👍🏻

They may be a little more expensive but the fish is generous, fresh, and varied, with rotating specials and a menu that's based on the catches they get in. Get in early and be prepared to wait - this popular kaitenzushi spot is busy every day of the week.

橋渡し設定では、倉庫系と言われる様なパワーがかなり入っていてアームもMAXまで開く台が私は好きで良くプレイするのですが、その様な台の場合は動画の様に力で回して落としちゃう事が出来るので是非やってみて下さい！！
(ナルト疾風伝フィギュアまで集め出したらもう棚に入らないからやめようと思っていたのですが、落としたい衝動がそれを越えていきました、、、)

あと、最近よく言われるのですが私はクレゲのプロではなく美容師で、ただのクレゲ好き(クレゲ病ではある)一般人ですのでお間違いなく　笑

●あくまでGETする一例ですので、どこのゲームセンターでも出来るという訳ではありませんのでご注意下さい。
●シールドの高さやパワーの入り具合、爪の角度、アームの捩れ具合などなど色々と要素があり、お店によって、台によってこの設定具合が違いますのであくまで参考程度にご視聴下さい。

Sarukame Ramen is on the Michelin Guide Seoul 2024 list! There is a bit of a queue for this popular ramen joint located in the trendy Yeonnam neighbourhood - there were already people lining up for it even before their opening time at 11.30 and I had to wait about 30 minutes before I managed to get a seat

The MUST TRY here is their famous clam ramen complate with half a crab, soft boiled eggs, al dente noodles and generous slices of ham I paid 14,800 Korean Won for this and it was worth every cent!

毎年大人気の｢いちごスイーツフェア｣は、今年はさらにパワーアップし6種類のスイーツが登場🍓❣️
どれも｢あまおう｣を贅沢に使っていて、いちご好きにはたまらなかったです🥹💕
.
イチオシの｢あまおうフラワークレープ｣は、なんとあまおうを10粒使用！
ぎっしり並ぶあまおうが圧巻で、インパクト抜群でしたよ😍
クリームはフルーツサンドに使っているクリームと同じだそうで、ミルク感のある練乳のような甘さが広がりました🧁
どこから食べても苺が堪能できて、とてもおいしかったです🫶🏻
.
｢いちごティラミス｣は毎年大人気で、いちごフェアでははずせないメニュー☺️💓
自家製ティラミスクリームに自家製エスプレッソを染み込ませたスポンジ、間には苺がごろごろと♪
とろっとしたなめらかクリームにエスプレッソのほろ苦さがアクセントに☕️
.
お皿にねかせたスタイルで提供される｢いちごクレープ｣は、2種類🍓
バターをたっぷりぬった生地にきび糖が合わせてあり、より軽い食べ心地になったそう😋
紅茶いちごクレープは生地に紅茶が練りこんであり、ふわっと広がる紅茶の風味がすごく良かったです😌🫖
添えてあるのはどちらもフルーツサンドと同じミルキークリームです！
.
｢パフェ｣はHOC( @hoc_cheesecake )さんオリジナルのホワイトチョコチーズケーキがどんっとのっています🧀
グラスの中はミルクジェラートや八角苺ジャム、ココナッツムースやライム、ジュレなど7種類で構成されていて、少し大人な味わい！
｢アフォガード｣は、すっきりとしたミルクジェラートに自家製いちごジャムや自家製エスプレッソをお好みで合わせて楽しめます🥰
.
どれも本当においしかったから、ぜひいろいろ食べてみてほしいです🤤🩷

This spot specializes in tangyuan, a rice ball similar to mochi, which is traditionally served sweet, but they’re doing something different and making it savory. 

We gotta admit we had our doubts at first.. but it turned out to be so delicious. The outer layer is soft and chewy while the inside is super flavorful. A little weird but in the best way 🤣

But try it for yourself and let us know what you think!

The best part about being in Korea would be the 24/7 deliveries, especially food !! I’ve seen ads for this rather newer Korean chicken brand all over the subway stations & tv throughout my stay, @puradak_official 🍗

If you’ve never heard of it, the name comes from Pura (pure) and Dak (Chicken in Korean) and the chicken brand sets itself unique to be a “designer/ luxury” chicken brand and that’s the concept they go by which is why the price point may be slightly higher and the packaging is also different than what you may see in regular chicken brands. The Black Aglio flavor is the most popular on the menu! The logo used to actually be very similar to Prada in its earlier days which is when it became well-known but it’s now changed to what you see in the reel!

My thoughts? 👍👍👍👍 out of 5. Try it if you’re in the country & haven’t had it yet :)

The Taiwanese government is giving away $2.5B NTD ($80M USD). That’s a lot of money! They don’t share official win rates, but we won 2/4 tries, so it was 50% for us and we saw plenty of other people winning, too! 

I know, 5000NTD is only around $160, but…that goes really far in Taiwan. Imagine you decided to spend all the money on papaya milks from 7-11: That would be ONE HUNDRED papaya milks! 

Mack (our two-year-old) won the cash card and we had so much fun letting him treat us to meals and train rides. We got a dinner for all four of us for $6USD, so he could have fed us for 3 meals a day for over a week! 

The website to register is called “Taiwan the Lucky Land” and it made us feel so lucky to be in Taiwan!

@johnrickalmonte and I flew to Seoul for a ""beauty trip"". First thing on my list is the viral 15-step scalp stem cell treatment at @eco_jardin! This has been on my bucket list for so long! And the fact that it originally started at Eco Jardin, I know I just had to get the treatment from them!

I'll list down all the 15 steps, if you're curious! The treatment costs 180,000 krw or about $135 and it's super worth it!!

1. Microscopic consultation and diagnosis - prepare to be humbled
2. Cleaning and exfoliating using natural aroma oil massage - removes dead skin cells, contaminants, and impurities, while stimulating blood circulation
3. Galvanic sealing brush - helps scalp absorb the oil effectively
4. Invigorating scrub - the mint extract cools the scalp to help with inflammation
5. Therapeutic steam mist - enhances the treatment
6. Neck massage oil
7. Neck muscle relaxation machine
8. Relaxing hot towel
9. Hair nourishing shampoo - mildly acidic shampoo
10. Y stick treatment - to remove metal components
11. Yume spa bed relaxation - there's just something about the sound of flowing water that is so soothing
12. Re-diagnosis of scalp - prepare to be shocked when they show you before and after
13. Hair growth tonic 
14. T stick infusion - enhances absorption of tonic
15. Styling

Tag someone you wanna do this with!

1. HAIR SALON: I still can’t believe that got a full hair and scalp treatment, cut and style for $200 (AUD). I went to my appointment only wanting a haircut but after checking out the prices I was sold! Had such an amazing experience at this salon. They even provided snacks and phone chargers.📍ParkJun Beauty Lab Myeongdong 
 

2. RENT A SCHOOL UNIFORM TO EXPLORE LOTTE WORLD: This was such a wholesome and nostalgic experience and it may seem weird but you’ll see everyone at Lotte World wearing one! Seriously the most fun I had on this trip. 📍Ehwa Korean School Uniform Rental 

3. PERSONAL COLOUR ANALYSIS: I actually found this very insightful and some of the findings quite shocking… I was really happy to know that I could wear my favourite colour pink! 📍Mood Collect Personal Colour, Gangnam

4. MYEONGDONG SHOPPING STREET: This vibrant strip is an all in one stop for clothing, k-beauty, souvenirs and delicious street-food! I have to say I preferred to shop in Hongdae (especially for clothes) but Myeongdong is definitely worth checking out! 

5. STARFIELD LIBRARY: The insta famous library in Seoul! It’s a beautiful functional library with the most aesthetic towering bookshelves. It is a very busy tourist spot which takes away from the appeal a little bit. I would recommend going earlier when it’s quieter. Otherwise, it’s free to visit!📍Starfield COEX Mall

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C2lEMnShk20/3289053561870503348,"MY BUSAN EATING LIST 

There is so much good food in Busan, I feel like I’ve only scratched the surface with what I’ve eaten. Here’s a list of only the places I enjoyed and would recommend. 

•••

SSANGDUNGI DWAEJI GUKBAP
2, UN Pyeonghwa-ro 13-beon-gil, Nam-gu (Daeyeon branch)
Come here for: The famed Busan pork soup and rice. This seaside city is littered with specialty shops selling the dish, which apparently are all good, and have their devotees and queues. I can’t say much more; but Ssangdungi (aka “Twins”) is amazing and crave-worthy. The smaller Daeyeon branch seemed superior to the larger capacity main branch. 

SUMININE
118 Cheongsapo-ro 58-beon-gil, Haeundae-gu
Come here for: Epic seafood BBQ. Suminine (aka “Sumin’s”) consistently tops search engine results. Scallops in shell, live eel, abalone, prawn… all grilled over charcoal at the table. Ideal location: Cheongsapo twin lighthouses and Haeundae Blueline Park rides. FYI the ahjummas can get a little hectic with service. 

SOKSIWONHAN DAEGUTANG
229 Namugadeun, Dalmaji-gil, Haeundae-gu
Come here for: “Daegutang” (literally big mouth soup) or codfish soup, a Busan specialty. Only one dish: fresh fish simmered in water for hours. An exquisite meal; but eat while it’s hot. 

SEUNGGI SSIAT HOTTEOK
BIFF Square
Come here for: The popular Busan street food snack: “hotteok”. Pancakes are filled with cinnamon, brown sugar and nuts and pan fried in a pool of butter. Indulgent, but a must. 

JEJU-GA
6-9 Jungangdae-ro 196-beon-gil, Dong-gu
Come here for: Abalone. Fresh, live ones. Grilled in butter on hot plate. Steamed whole. In spicy broth. Poached in rice congee flavoured by its liver.

There is so much good food in Busan, I feel like I’ve only scratched the surface with what I’ve eaten. Here’s a list of only the places I enjoyed and would recommend. 

•••

SSANGDUNGI DWAEJI GUKBAP
2, UN Pyeonghwa-ro 13-beon-gil, Nam-gu (Daeyeon branch)
Come here for: The famed Busan pork soup and rice. This seaside city is littered with specialty shops selling the dish, which apparently are all good, and have their devotees and queues. I can’t say much more; but Ssangdungi (aka “Twins”) is amazing and crave-worthy. The smaller Daeyeon branch seemed superior to the larger capacity main branch. 

SUMININE
118 Cheongsapo-ro 58-beon-gil, Haeundae-gu
Come here for: Epic seafood BBQ. Suminine (aka “Sumin’s”) consistently tops search engine results. Scallops in shell, live eel, abalone, prawn… all grilled over charcoal at the table. Ideal location: Cheongsapo twin lighthouses and Haeundae Blueline Park rides. FYI the ahjummas can get a little hectic with service. 

SOKSIWONHAN DAEGUTANG
229 Namugadeun, Dalmaji-gil, Haeundae-gu
Come here for: “Daegutang” (literally big mouth soup) or codfish soup, a Busan specialty. Only one dish: fresh fish simmered in water for hours. An exquisite meal; but eat while it’s hot. 

SEUNGGI SSIAT HOTTEOK
BIFF Square
Come here for: The popular Busan street food snack: “hotteok”. Pancakes are filled with cinnamon, brown sugar and nuts and pan fried in a pool of butter. Indulgent, but a must. 

JEJU-GA
6-9 Jungangdae-ro 196-beon-gil, Dong-gu
Come here for: Abalone. Fresh, live ones. Grilled in butter on hot plate. Steamed whole. In spicy broth. Poached in rice congee flavoured by its liver. 

CHORYANG MILMYEON

I had three Dak-galbi and one Bibim-noodle(비빔막국수) with my family. In 80s and 90s, Korean people didn't put cheese on our Korean authentic foods. But kids love cheese thesedays, so most Korean restaurants put cheese on Dak-galbi if customers ask them to.

After eating the Dak-galbi, I ordered three fried rice. Korean people always eat fried rice after Dak-galbi. Total cost was KRW 63,000 (USD 48). Pretty cheap, isn't it? This is why Korean people love this cuisine. 

This restaurant is located near HYBE Headquarters. So, I took my daughter to the building. She is a big fan of BTS. I took several memorable pictures. 😀😀 

* Dak-galbi (닭갈비), or spicy stir-fried chicken, is a popular Korean dish made by stir-frying marinated diced chicken in a gochujang-based sauce with sweet potatoes, cabbage, perilla leaves, scallions, tteok (rice cake), and other ingredients.

Fifth day is in the Hongdae area. I’ve chosen activities that locals often enjoy. Before heading to Hongdae, let‘s start by visiting Hongjecheon. This place, where an artificial waterfall was recently created, has become a popular spot attracting many visitors. The artificial waterfall is impressive, and behind it, a small hill is covered with numerous blooming flowers, making it a great place to enjoy spring blossoms.

After that, we’ll move on to Mangwon Market. Here, you can enjoy some local snacks or have lunch at one of the many small restaurants in Mangwon-dong. 

After lunch, we‘ll proceed to Yeonnamdong, located near Hongdae. Yeonnamdong, adjacent to Hongdae, is filled with trendy restaurants and cafes. Don’t miss walking along Gyeongui Line Forest Park. When you pass Hongdae Station, there‘s a charming railway track. 

Next, we’ll stroll along Hongdae Street. In the afternoon, there are less crowds, making it a perfect time for cafe hopping or visiting street fashion stores for some shopping. 

Moving on to Hapjeong, which is known as a local gathering place with plenty of delicious restaurants and cafes. I recommend having dinner here. 

After that, in the Mangwon area, there is a street adorned with cherry blossoms. It‘s beautiful during the day, but the evening lighting adds an extra charm, making it more enchanting at night.

Following that, walk on Hongdae Street in the evening. Although you walked through Hongdae Street in the afternoon, the atmosphere changes in the evening. Many people come out for busking, street food stalls emerge, and the place becomes livlier.

After that, we’ll move on to Mangwon Market. Here, you can enjoy some local snacks or have lunch at one of the many small restaurants in Mangwon-dong. 

After lunch, we‘ll proceed to Yeonnamdong, located near Hongdae. Yeonnamdong, adjacent to Hongdae, is filled with trendy restaurants and cafes. Don’t miss walking along Gyeongui Line Forest Park. When you pass Hongdae Station, there‘s a charming railway track. 

Next, we’ll stroll along Hongdae Street. In the afternoon, there are less crowds, making it a perfect time for cafe hopping or visiting street fashion stores for some shopping. 

Moving on to Hapjeong, which is known as a local gathering place with plenty of delicious restaurants and cafes. I recommend having dinner here. 

After that, in the Mangwon area, there is a street adorned with cherry blossoms. It‘s beautiful during the day, but the evening lighting adds an extra charm, making it more enchanting at night.

Following that, walk on Hongdae Street in the evening. Although you walked through Hongdae Street in the afternoon, the atmosphere changes in the evening. Many people come out for busking, street food stalls emerge, and the place becomes livlier.

We cannot get over how savory the broth was!
‼️This place is BUSY so the line may be long but it moves fast! It’s easier to have a party of 2 because you move along quicker. Note that you may be sat right next to people you don’t know. So if you’re uncomfortable with that, take note!
Everything in this restaurant is made in house! 
From google: Kal-guksu is a Korean noodle dish consisting of handmade, knife-cut wheat flour noodles served in a large bowl with broth and other ingredients. It is traditionally considered a seasonal food, consumed most often in summer.

This place is known for crafting French toasts using homemade Brioche bread. They take pride in maintaining the perfect thickness for a moist and fluffy texture, and to achieve this, they close their bakery three times a week, operating only on Thursdays and weekends. The owner personally handcrafts their most cherished French toast.

For a limited time during winter, they are showcasing the Strawberry French Toast, which features a delightful harmony of raspberry jam and strawberry cream. The outer layer is crisped to perfection with butter, while the interior is moistened by the egg mixture, creating a pudding-like softness. The distinct texture of Brioche is skillfully retained, adding to the unique appeal of their French toast.

- Location: 71-12 Poreun-ro, Mapo-gu, Seoul
- Operating Hours: Closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, Open from 10:00 AM to 5:30 PM
- Signature Dish: Strawberry French Toast (₩10,900)

Rice Dessert Cafe Inspired by Haitai

해태의 이야기를 공간에 풀어 낸
‘해태의 정원’ 콘셉트의 카페 ‘이로’가
서초동에 오늘 가오픈을 시작합니다.

1층과 지하 공간 두 개의 층으로 구성되며
해태의 특성인 물, 불, 구름, 바람을 
그림자와 안개 등 현상학적 가치를 이용해 
공간에 표현하였습니다.

메뉴는 누룽지와 쌀과자 등
쌀을 비롯한 곡물을 적극 활용한
한국식 디저트를 선보입니다.

계절에 따라 변화하는 산의 모습을
형상화한 케이크 ‘해치의 신수림’은
무화과, 홍시 등 세 가지 맛이 준비되어 있으며 
쌀과자를 이용해 담백한 맛과 
바삭한 식감을 더했습니다.

또 곡물을 이용한 해태 모양의 샌드와
수묵화를 연상시키는 해치크림라떼 등
‘이로’만의 정체성을 나타내는
멋스러운 디저트를 만날 수 있습니다.

*오픈 전 지인의 초대로 다녀왔습니다.

⁣
If you’re ever visiting Hakodate, the first thing you need to do is get a reservation at Benten Sushi! This small restaurant run by the owner and his wife, seats maybe 6-8 people⁣
⁣
Very homey and cozy, but with the freshest fish for an affordable price. We both got the ¥4500 omakase, which came with 15 pieces of nigiri. We even ordered a few extra pieces and we both had 20 pieces of nigiri, with alcohol for around ¥6500 each.⁣
⁣
Each bite was incredibly flavourful - each fish had its own unique taste. Everything was fresh, juicy, amazing!⁣
⁣
If I could recommend one restaurant in all of Japan it would be Benten Sushi 🫶 Please give them a try and let the owner I sent you (he asked me to tell all my friends about his sushi, so I’m sharing to the world 🤭)⁣

I love a seafood buffet 🍱 especially one with a massive bowl of ikura (salmon roe) to make your own rice bowls with. They have heaps of sweet and savoury, eastern and western options, so you’ll definitely be able to fill up on your favourites. 

And I loved the concept of the private onens (baths). There are actually 5 different private onsens 🛁 you can visit and bathe in, each with different features (such as minerals and water) that allow you to truly unwind and reap the benefits. There is also a large public bath ♨️ so you really get to enjoy the best of both worlds. With so many things to enjoy at this hotel, you’ll want to stay in it all day! 

Other amazing features of the hotel 
- Free AYCE ramen bowls for supper 🍜 
- Tatami floors all over the hotel 🎋
- 1 station away from Kyoto Station 🚉
- Great value at approx JPY 30,000 per night for 2 during non peak season 🙌🏻

📍Hapjeong-Sangsu (📸 April 1, 2023)
📍Yeouido (📸 April 2, 2023)
(*last three are all near each other—)

Every year, I visit different areas that I couldn’t in that short time frame. Cherry blossoms bloom and then peak for only a couple days, before the wind blows them all away!! Follow to see where I visit this year 💕

*locations even peak before others in Seoul because of the direction the sunlight hits the area* 

Other places to see Cherry blossoms in Seoul:
📍Children’s Grand Park 
📍Namsan Park
📍Seoul Forest
📍Yangjae Stream
📍Banpocheon Stream

Noodle lovers will appreciate that theirs are handmade without any gelatin or artificial stuff for a really smooth, firm and perfectly chewy rice noodle. They also give you unlimited refills cause they know you’ll want more. 

What’s cool is that they stick with the fresh stuff and nothing artificial. The flavours of the soups are unreal and come from simmering bones for over 12 hours!  No shortcuts here. It’s like they’re saying, “Hey nature, you’re the real MVP.” Natural, locally sourced, no fake stuff. 

Now, the main event - the Crossing-the-Bridge Rice Noodles. This dish is like the Sasquatch of Ottawa; you’ve heard legends but you rarely see it in Ottawa restaurants. It’s got a backstory older than all of us at MyOttawa combined - over 100 years! They serve you a tasty boiling pot of broth with all the meats, veggies and noodles on the side. You throw in what you like and cook it how you like it. It’s like jazz for your taste buds, you improvise and get it exactly the way you want it. 

It’s amazing but just make sure you save some room for great appetizers, spicy sides, authentic Chinese cold dishes to cool you off and tasty Chinese desserts! And it’s all VERY reasonably priced. 

So if you’re Noodle Lover in Ottawa and you wanna taste something that’s been perfected before your great grandma was in high school, check out @yunshangricenoodle It’s an experience that’ll have you coming back faster than you can say “refill on the rice noodles, please.”

How INFP survives a party

요즘 특이점 온 찜질방
1분만에 티켓 매진되었다는 성수동 라성스파에서 한
짐빔의 찜질방데이즈를 다녀왔습니다

🥃 찜질방데이즈 살아남는 방법
1. 입장 하자마자 짐빔 식혜 +  계란 구매
2. 슬쩍 멀리서 리듬타며 구경하기
3. 짐빔 하이볼 하나 들고 레이브 즐기기 

👕 찜질방데이즈 꿀팁
1. 찜질복과 수건은 그냥 줌. 기념으로 가져가세요
(나는 진짜 찜질복인줄 알고 놓고옴 ^_ㅠ)
2. 양말 벗고 이용하기. 역시 찜질방은 맨발이 최고임

찜질방에서 짐빔 마시며 춤추는 이 모습
태어나서 처음 본 광경에 웃겼지만
너무 재밌었고 신기한 경험이었다

그래서 3차 언제하신다고요?

📍성수동 라성스파, 서울

Inspired by Tokyo’s standing sushi concept, and led by an alumna chef of Sushi Nakazawa and Sushi Ginza Onodera. Sendo is one of the best NYC restaurant openings of the year. Possibly dethroning Sugarfish all at once.

The $47 Hokkaido Sendo Sets is already the most expensive set on the menu. This includes 10 Nigiris, 2 Handroll, and 1 Kaisendon. That price and quality are honestly unbeatable.

The King Salmon was a standout. It has a strong umami bite with a soft finish. 

The Otoro became the breaking point of what makes Sendo hella WORTH IT. 

The cut was perfectly thick, marbled, and fresh. Coated in their aged in-house soy sauce that took 7 days to make. The Otoro just straight-up melted in our mouths, and the fish-to-rice ratio was a chef’s kiss.

We also love the Sea Bream, Spanish Mackeral, Hokkaido scallops, and Bluefin Tuna. 

The handrolls were great but we did wish the nori was crispier. It was slightly too soggy during our visit. 

The Kaisendon had a variety of fish cuts mixed with pickled daikon radish on top of sushi rice. At this point, we were already so stuffed.

Run to Sendo now and thank us later!

Special thanks to @heyjessehsu for sharing this gem on the day of our flight back! 

Pro tip: Hidden on the 2nd floor of a random building! Once you see a pizza spot, find the door that leads you up the stairs, it’s the first door on your right! Come right on their opening hour for a shorter waiting time! Walk-ins only.

That's exactly the type of experience you'll get here @nord_lyon, and not many people know about this buffet because it's kind of hidden. Like it's at the very end of the bakery and it's blocked off by a yellow divider, but once you know about it, you'll be wanting to come back every weekend from 9am to 2:30pm for some French gastronomy.

To be fair, I only expected this buffet to have some pastries and desserts. Little did I know, this buffet has it all! All the savoury brunch dishes we all crave during this time of day, and of course all the traditional French desserts we've come to expect from a French bakery. Don't forget to get your made-to-order omlette straight off the skillet too! 

This is definitely a hidden gem in Toronto. Now that the secret is out, I'll see you all there!

-
📍50 Baekbeom-ro 99-gil, Yongsan-gu, Seoul, South Korea
-
Mongtan is a must-visit Korean BBQ restaurant in Seoul, famed for its straw-grilled beef short ribs, known as Woodae Galbi. Locals rave about the smoky, juicy flavor of this dish, which is first pre-cooked over straw, giving it a unique smokey aroma. The atmosphere inside is distinctly modern, with a central furnace where the chefs prepare the ribs, visible to diners, adding an exciting touch to the meal. It has like gotham vibes, you’ll know what I mean. 

Highlights

📌 The star of the menu is definitely the Woodae Galbi, marinated and cooked to perfection on a hot lid at your table. This method ensures even heat retention, which is perfect for bbq. It’s tender, flavorful meat that melts in your mouth.
📌 Banchan is plentiful and unique, with standouts like onion kimchi and iced radish kimchi. The green perilla leaf pesto is a sauce you won’t forget!
📌 Don’t miss the Yukhoe, a delightful raw beef dish with octopus, which is both fresh and full of texture, or the refreshing iced bibim noodles—perfect on a hot day.
📌 Fried Rice - this is a must order when you have a few pieces of meat left. Trust me, it’s so good and addictive. 

With a wait time of hours, Mongtan’s popularity speaks for itself. But trust me, the exceptional quality of the food and its distinct sweet, smokey and juicy flavor make the wait worth every minute. Make sure to get there early or plan ahead if you want a spot!

Umamia @umamia_mtl 
📍259 Rue du Séminaire, Montréal, QC H3C 2A4

This is one of the best sushi spots 🍣in Montreal, where you can see the chefs create the sushi rolls and nigiris in front of you (open kitchen).
All the pieces were exceptionally good! I highly recommend 😍

✨I also need to highlight their appetizers. The nori wasabi chips were out of this world. Loved their karaage, salmon tartare, dumplings and especially, their lobster infused miso soup (I’ll come back for that soup tbh 🥣)

👉It’s bring your own wine 🍷, which is rare in Griffintown.

Thank you so much @mininekomtl for extending the invite and @umamia_mtl for the delicious meal ❤️

A Majestic Cave-Inspired Black Pork Specialty Restaurant: Jeju Rooftop Black BBQ

Located in the heart of Apgujeong, this restaurant brings the authentic taste of Jeju Island to the city. With details like placing grills atop stone walls, the atmosphere exudes the charm of Jeju Island.

The signature menu, Black BBQ, allows you to savor various cuts such as pork belly, pork neck, and pork jowl all at once. By undergoing both wet-aging and dry-aging processes, the flavors are deeply enriched while maintaining the unique chewy texture of black pork. The slightly crispy and chewy texture of the pork belly fat is especially impressive.

The galchi-sauce fried rice, perfectly seared for a crispy finish, is also a delight, and side dishes are thoughtfully prepared and served individually. This is a place where both taste and atmosphere come together.

Kobi used to specialize in Kbbq but with the recent rebranding, many exciting dishes have been added to the menu on top of the kbbq- including these sotbabs, yukhoes (beef tartar) and potate fries ✨ the sotbabs come in many different flavours including steak, sea bass, eel, chicken, eggplant, oyster, mushroom, abalone, seafood, pork 👏

The plating and decor was really on point and what was most amazing about this was the affordable price - all the sotbabs were under $20 and when you add side dishes and soup all still around $22-24. Not common in this economy!!! Highly recommend, actually going back today to try some other flavours 🥺

Noodle prices are a bit on the higher end from $14-17 but the portion sizes are large as each main comes with a free refill. The ambience itself is totally worth checking out alone, especially if you’re trying to zone out or need a break from certain people in life … 😶‍🌫️

Here’s a post from a guy who grew from zero to 1,000,000 followers in two months on Instagram.

He shares how he did it in this post, “0-1m followers in exactly 2 months. AMA.”

The craziest thing he did…

High frequency posting, he posted 12 times per day.

High frequency posting is a well known way to grow on Instagram, but so few people do it.

After posting 12 times a day, he tapered off to posting 5 times per day.

Aside from high frequency posting, there’s a lot of straightforward advice given.

Don’t post watermarks from other platforms.

Have stable, high quality video.

Stay within a consistent subject matter. Don’t cover a million niches on your account.

What’s crazy is the poster has grown many Instagram accounts. 

He has lots of experience in tons of niches and shares it all in this post on the Instagram Marketing subreddit.",edward.builds,2024-12-07_18-30-21_UTC.mp4,r/InstagramMarketing,,r/InstagramMarketing,
